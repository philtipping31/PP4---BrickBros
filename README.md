### Agile Working

Before I began coding my project, I set up an Issues template in GitHub and linked it with a board for user stories. In addition, labels and milestones were created ensure my project work was planned accordingly based on the time I had to finish and submit the work.

User stories were added to sprints to allow me to focus on sections of work at a particular time. 

As things occured, other items would be introduced and re-prioritised, enforcing the agile methodology of working.

## Website Design

### Wire Frames

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - This was to allow me a base design to work from when creating the website.

### Colour Scheme

I used a mono colour scheme with a yellow addition to reference the lego theme.

### Data Model

My data model was drawn up before creating the actual model to serve a template/blueprint before adding it into my models.py file.
