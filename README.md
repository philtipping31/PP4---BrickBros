## Contents


## User Experience (UX)

Brick Bros is a lego build sharing site. Allowing users full CRUD functionality once registered and logged into a profile. The site allows a user to post their own lego builds and share with the community as well as view other users builds.

### First Time User Goals

- As a first time user I want to be able to understand the purpose of the website as soon as I land on the home page.
- As a first time user I want to be able to look at posted lego builds.
- As a first time user I want to be able to know that I need to register or login to add my own posts.
- As a first time user I want to easily create an account and be notified that I am logged in.
- As a first time user I want to be able to create a post once I am logged in.
- As a first time user I want to be able to edit and delete my own posts once I am logged in.
- As a first time user I want to be notified of any changes I make:
    - Post has been created
    - Post has been updated/edited
    - Post has been deleted
- As a first time user I want to be able to search for posts via the Model Number search bar.
- As a first time user I want to be able to navigate to the social media pages of the site easily.


### Returning User Goals

- As a returning user I want to know if I am still logged in to my account.
- As a returning user I want to be able to see other users posts the have been added recently (all posts are stored in most recently added order).
- As a returning user I want to be able to view, edit and delete my own posts.


### Agile Working

Before I began coding my project, I set up an Issues template in GitHub and linked it with a board for user stories. In addition, labels and milestones were created ensure my project work was planned accordingly based on the time I had to finish and submit the work.

User stories were added to sprints to allow me to focus on sections of work at a particular time. 

As things occured, other items would be introduced and re-prioritisied, enforcing the agile methodology of working.

## Website Design

### Wire Frames

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - This was to allow me a base design to work from when creating the website. 

![Home Wireframe](readmedocs/designs/home-wireframe.png)

![All Builds WireFrame](readmedocs/designs/allbuilds-wireframe.png)

![Add Build Wireframe](readmedocs/designs/add-wireframe.png)

![View Build Wireframe](readmedocs/designs/view-wireframe.png)


Using agile methodology some additional pages were added throughout the project which did not have wire-frames, however, are just adapted or copied versions of existing wire-frames.


### Colour Scheme

I used a mono colour scheme with a yellow addition to reference the lego theme.

![Colour Scheme](readmedocs/screenshots/colour-scheme.png)


### Data Model

My data models were drawn up before creating the actual model to serve a template/blueprint before adding it into my models.py file.

I used [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) to give an accurate representation of my ERD's (Entity Relationship Diagram).

![Model](readmedocs/screenshots/erd.png)



## WebPage Security

### env.py 

- Sensitive information is stored in the env.py to allow security of sensitive information on the website. API Keys and Database URL's are stored here in te env.py file which is not included in the version control and deployment to prevent unwanted access and exposure.

### Defensive Programming

- Coding techniques learnt in the course such as the syntax {%%}, @login_required and Django packages; LoginRequiredMixin and UserPassesTestMixin are used to restrict access for unauthorised users gaining access to pages/views on the site.
- A 403 page was also added for better UX if a user obtained a URL for a restricted view and was not authorised to perform said action.

### Input Validation

- Django Crispy forms is a useful tool used for adding posts on the website. The built in form allows for validating the form to ensure that fields are correctly filled out with the correct information and not left empty if required. 

### Toast Messages

- Django Messages are used throughout the website to notify the user of any action they perform. This was introduced for a better user experience and understanding of the site. 

- Messages included:

Logged in to the site
Logged out of the site
Added a build post
Edited a build post
Deleted a build post
Added a review


## Features

### General

The webpage is responsive to different screen sizes allowing the user to access the webpage on their desired device. Mobile first design was followed throughout. With the use of CSS Media Queries to alter the visual aspect of the page when the screen size is changed.

![Responsive Design](readmedocs/screenshots/responsive-design.png)

### NavBar

The nav bar is visible on every page due to being in the base.html file. The BrickBros logo is present as well showing if the user is logged in or logged out of the site.

The navbars state changes based on whether or not a user is logged in or logged out of the webpage. 

- Logged Out

![Logged Out Nav](readmedocs/screenshots/laptop-logged-out-nav.png)


- Logged In

![Logged In Nav](readmedocs/screenshots/laptop-loggedin-nav.png)


The navbar collapses to a 'hamburger' icon for screen sizes 320px - 990px for responsive designing.

- Logged Out

![Logged out tablet collapsed](readmedocs/screenshots/tablet-collapsed-nav.png)

![Logged out tablet expanded](readmedocs/screenshots/tablet-expanded-logged-out-nav.png)

- Logged In

![Logged in tablet expanded](readmedocs/screenshots/tablet-expanded-loggedin-nav.png)


### Home Page

The home page is the landing page for the website. It clearly shows the purpose of the website to the user with a quick access button to view all builds. 

![Home Page](readmedocs/screenshots/home-page-laptop.png)

![Home Page Tablet](readmedocs/screenshots/home-page-tablet.png)

### All Builds

The 'All Builds' page is the location where all users posts are displayed. They are ordered in most recently created. 

The builds are limited to 3 posts per page so avoid the need of scrolling. 

Each build has a brief overview on the screen to clearly show the user what the post is. If the user wishes to read more, they can click on the 'Read More' button which takes them through to the detailed view. 

![All Builds page](readmedocs/screenshots/all-builds-laptop.png)

![All builds tablet](readmedocs/screenshots/all-builds-tablet.png)

### Search Bar

The search bar is visible on the all builds page. This queries the database and looks for model numbers only. 

![Search bar](readmedocs/screenshots/search-bar.png)

Users can enter the set number of a build to see if it exists. 

Information will be shown to the user of the search they performed and show the results if applicable. If nothing matches their search criteria of a model number, no results will show and has a quick link to add a build as the first person to post.

![Search bar results](readmedocs/screenshots/search%20results.png)

![Search bar no results](readmedocs/screenshots/no-results.png)

### Detailed View 

The detailed view is displayed when a user choose to click the 'Read More' button on an individual post. This opens up a new view with all of the information about the users build post.

![Detailed post view](readmedocs/screenshots/detailed-view.png)

### Add Build

The add build page is a front end user interactable form which allows signed in users to add their posts to share with the BrickBros community. 

![Add Post](readmedocs/screenshots/add-post.png)

If a user is not singed in, the 'Add Build' page will ask them to login.

![Add Post Logged out](readmedocs/screenshots/add-post-logged-out.png)

If a user does not fill in required criteria, the post form will notify the user of any missing criteria.

![Missing info](readmedocs/screenshots/incomplete-post.png)

Once a user is logged in and filled in all required criteria, they will be notifed that the post was successful. 

![Success Post](readmedocs/screenshots/successful-post.png)


### Edit Build

If a user is logged into their own profile, they can click on one of their own posts. Either from the 'My Builds' page or locating it from the 'All Builds' screen.

In addition to the detailed view, the owner of the post will be able to Edit the post. (These options do not occur when viewing a post from a different user account).

![Edit Post button](readmedocs/screenshots/edit-button.png)

When the user clicks on edit. The add post form appears with the title 'Edit Post' - All previous fields are populated and will allow text to be removed/added to/updated. 

![Edit Post](readmedocs/screenshots/edit-form.png)

Once the edit is completed and submitted, the user will be notified that their edited post was successful.

![Edit Success](readmedocs/screenshots/edit-confirmed.png)

If an unauthenticated used obtains the URL path to edit a post they do not own, the 403 page will be displayed.


### Delete Build

The delete build option works in the exact same way as the edit build feature. 

However, the user will be asked to confirm whether or not they want to proceed with the post deletion when they do click delete. 

![Confirm Delete](readmedocs/screenshots/confirm-delete.png)

### My Builds

My builds is a navbar option for users that are logged in to their profile. 

This page is a copy of the all builds page but only displays the builds for the logged in user.

![My Builds](readmedocs/screenshots/my-builds.png)

If the user has not posted anything yet, this information will be shown to the user with a quick link to add their first post.

![No builds](readmedocs/screenshots/no-builds.png)


### Messages

A variety of 'toast' messages are displayed throughout the site to notify a user that the action they performed was successful. 

These messages include:

    - Successful Login
    - Successful Logout
    - Added a Post
    - Edited a Post
    - Deleted a Post

The messages were styled inline with the website colour scheme, overriding bootstraps default styles.

![Toast Message](readmedocs/screenshots/message.png)


### Login / Logout / Register

The user account pages were styled with css to fit in with the colour scheme used throughout the site. Some minor text changes were implemented, however the bulk of these pages was taken from Django's AllAuth package. 

- Login Page

![Login](readmedocs/screenshots/sign-in.png)


- Logout Page

![Logout](readmedocs/screenshots/sign-out.png)


- Register Page

![Register](readmedocs/screenshots/register.png)



### Accessibility 

Using the following elements, I tried to ensure the website was made as accessible as possible by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using aria-labels for screen readers.
- Using alt attributes on images where available.
- A responsive design, allowing users to view and visit the site on a variety of devices.
- Using a simple colour scheme, allowing for appropriate contrasts between the text and background.
- Font sizes and styling are easily readable.
- Front end forms provide user feedback when required.
- Toast messages display notifying the user of performed actions.


### 403, 404 and 500 pages

A 403 page was created and tested so that if a user tries to access a URL to delete a post when they do not own it, the 403 page is displayed notifying the user that they are not authorized to perform the action. 

![403 page](readmedocs/screenshots/403-page.png)




A 404 page was created so that if a user enters an incorrect URL they will be given a 404 page notifying them of this and allow the user to navigate to the home page easily.

![404 page](readmedocs/screenshots/404-page.png)



A 500 page was created for internal server errors. Showing the user that the issue is with the webpage and not them.

![500 Page](readmedocs/screenshots/500-page.png)


## Features not yet implemented

- User profile, this would consist of the my builds in condensed view, liked builds, edit/update and delete user profile.
- Auto populate the slug field on Add Post to improve user experience. I could only work this out from an Admin point and not a front end user. 
- Front end edit and delete reviews. This can be controlled by the admin site only.
- Draft Posts - This would allow a user to draft a post and save it for later, linking to the user profile section.
- Lego Categories - Have an option on the add build to categorise the build. This would of then filtered into a navbar menu for Categories. Allowing a user to just view posts relating to a particular lego category.
