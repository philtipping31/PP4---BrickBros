# Documented Manual Testing for | BrickBros

This project was tested throughout the duration of the project creation. This was done with ensuring the user story / feature was designed and working as intended when being coded.
The project was also tested frequently via Google Chrome Dev Tools for display issues. 


## Validation Testing
